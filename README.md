# Gift'ed
A GO-JEK assignment to build a giphy website in a space optimized grid.

---

## Project set-up
1. Run `make` script from terminal with a command `npm run make` which will
    a)  `clean`: To remove node_modules if already present
    b) `Install`: dependencies and dev-dependencies
    c) `Bundle`: To webpack your project
    d) `Serve`: Run your applicationn on http-server

# Points to Note
1. The application is built right from the scratch without using any `Framework`
2. This is just a MVP of what can be developed as this is meant to be an assignment.
3. Only `Infinite scrolling` has been added due to time constraint.
4. Other features that I can think of:
    a) Toggle between `GIF` and `Stickers`
    b) Search suggestions
    c) A section dedicated on `Trending GIF's`
    d) Copy link of GIF on the `clipboard`
    e) Optimized Processing using [Request-Animation-Frame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) and [Request-Idle-Callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback)
